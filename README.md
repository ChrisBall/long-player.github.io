!It's not working yet!

This is puzzle I made during the Covid-19 pandemic. It's intended to be a work in progress, so the puzzle may change over time. 
I'm not a web developer, and fundamentally fairly lazy - feel free to post issues, but don't expect them to be addressed promptly.
If there are issues with the player, it's possibly to [download the original mp3](https://soundcloud.com/user-358161767/2451g) and solve the puzzles - but it will be harder.

It's been made with: 

**P5.js (for the interface) [Donate](https://p5js.org/community/)**

**Audacity (for the audio editing) [Donate](https://www.audacityteam.org/donate/)**

**extensive use of freesound.com (for various audio samples) [Donate](https://freesound.org/donations/donate/)**


These are all free projects - please consider donating money or time to them.
